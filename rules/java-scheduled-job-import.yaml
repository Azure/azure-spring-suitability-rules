advice: The application has scheduled jobs such as Quartz Scheduler tasks or cron jobs. 
        Azure Spring App won't prevent you from deploying an application containing scheduled tasks internally.
        However, if your application is scaled out, the same scheduled job may run more than once per scheduled period.
        This situation can lead to unintended consequences.
